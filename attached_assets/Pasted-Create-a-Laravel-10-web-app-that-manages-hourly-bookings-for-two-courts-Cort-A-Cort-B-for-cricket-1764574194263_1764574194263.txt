Create a Laravel 10 web app that manages hourly bookings for two courts (Cort A, Cort B) for cricket and football, shows available slots for a selected day, and includes an admin dashboard with booking creation (form: name, phone, amount) and graphs on the home page.

Requirements & behavior (high-level)

Two courts: Court A and Court B (storeable/configurable).

Two sports:

Cricket — 2000 per hour per court.

Football — 2500 per hour per court.

Working hours configurable (default 06:00 — 23:00). Slots are hourly (06:00–07:00, 07:00–08:00, …).

Dynamic daily availability: show each hourly slot for the requested date and court(s) marked Available or Booked.

Prevent double-booking (no overlapping bookings for same court & hour).

Booking form fields: name, phone_number, sport, court, date, start_time, hours (number of hours), and amount (auto-calculated).

Admin dashboard (authenticated) to:

Create, list, edit, cancel bookings.

See key metrics and graphs on the homepage (revenue today/week/month, bookings count, busiest court, occupancy %).

Use Blade + Tailwind CSS for UI.

Use Chart.js for charts and DataTables (or similar) for listing bookings with AJAX.

Use Axios for AJAX requests.

Provide migrations, seeders (sample courts, sample bookings), factories, and tests (unit for booking logic + feature tests for booking creation & double-book prevention).

Provide detailed README with run instructions (Replit-ready).

Tech stack & libraries (explicit)

Laravel 10 (or latest stable)

PHP 8.1+

MySQL (or SQLite for Replit convenience)

Composer, NPM/Vite

Tailwind CSS

Chart.js (for charts)

DataTables OR Tabulator (for bookings table)

Axios (AJAX)

Laravel Breeze (simple auth) or Jetstream (Breeze preferred for simplicity)

Pest or PHPUnit for tests

Data model (suggested schema)

courts

id (pk)

name (string) — Court A, Court B

created_at, updated_at

sports

id (pk)

name (string) — Cricket, Football

price_per_hour (integer)

created_at, updated_at

bookings

id (pk)

uuid (string) — public booking id

name (string)

phone (string)

sport_id (fk -> sports)

court_id (fk -> courts)

date (date) — booking date

start_time (time) — slot start (HH:MM:SS)

hours (integer) — how many hours

amount (integer) — calculated price (hours * price_per_hour)

status (enum) — booked, cancelled, completed

created_at, updated_at

settings (optional)

id

key

value

Business logic (detailed)

Slot generation: For a given date and court, generate hourly slots between opening_time and closing_time (configurable). Each slot is a start_time (e.g. 09:00) and duration 1 hour. Multi-hour booking occupies consecutive hourly slots.

Availability check when creating a booking: for the requested court and date, ensure none of the requested hourly slots overlap with existing bookings with status booked. If overlap — return validation error.

Auto-calc amount = hours * sport.price_per_hour. Show on frontend dynamically as sport/hours change.

If booking crosses midnight or outside working hours — validation error.

Soft-cancel: status = cancelled.

API / Routes (examples)

Web (Blade):

GET / — public homepage with quick booking widget + graphs for admin if logged in.

GET /availablity?date=YYYY-MM-DD&court_id=1&sport_id=1 — returns JSON list of slots with availability (for AJAX).

GET /bookings/create — booking form.

POST /bookings — create booking.

GET /bookings — bookings list (admin) (AJAX DataTable).

GET /dashboard — admin dashboard with charts.

POST /bookings/{booking}/cancel — cancel booking.

API (optional)

GET /api/slots — returns slots and availability for specified date/court/sport.

POST /api/bookings — create booking.

Frontend behavior (UX details)

Availability view: calendar/date-picker -> when date is selected, make AJAX request to /availablity and render hourly slots for both courts side-by-side. Each slot shows time, sport price, and button Book (if available) or Booked.

Booking form: when user clicks Book on a slot, open modal with form prefilled (date, start_time, court, sport). The hours input defaults to 1. Amount displayed and recalculated client-side.

Dashboard graphs:

Revenue (line chart) — last 7 days.

Bookings count (bar chart) — bookings per day/week.

Occupancy pie/doughnut — percentage of booked slots per court.

Table: recent bookings with filters (date range, court, sport, status).

Validation messages: friendly messages when slot already taken, invalid phone, or outside hours.

Security & validation

Use Laravel validation rules for required fields.

Validate phone number format (E.164 optional) or at least regex:/^[0-9\-\+ ]{7,20}$/.

CSRF protection on forms.

Auth-protected admin routes (use Breeze to scaffold).

Tests (what to include)

Unit test for Booking::isAvailable($court_id, $date, $start_time, $hours) that checks overlapping and non-overlapping cases.

Feature test for creating booking (success) and feature test for creating overlapping booking (fails).

Optional: integration test for amount calculation.

Seeders & factories

CourtsSeeder: create Court A and Court B.

SportsSeeder: create Cricket (2000) and Football (2500).

BookingsFactory: generate sample bookings for the last week (to populate charts).

File & code structure guidance

app/Models/Booking.php — booking logic + scope for date range and availability checks.

app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php — create, store, index, cancel.

app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php — provide aggregated data endpoints for charts.

resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php — main layout (Tailwind).

resources/js/bookings.js — Axios calls for availability / booking form.

resources/js/dashboard.js — Chart.js initialization and AJAX fetches.

routes/web.php — routes listed above.

database/migrations/* — migrations matching model spec.

database/seeders/* — seeders for courts/sports/bookings.

tests/Feature/BookingTest.php & tests/Unit/BookingTest.php.

Replit-specific & run instructions (put these in README)

Use SQLite in Replit for simplicity. In .env, set DB_CONNECTION=sqlite and create database/database.sqlite file.

Commands to run (Replit run command should run these steps):

composer install

cp .env.example .env

generate app key php artisan key:generate

ensure database/database.sqlite exists: touch database/database.sqlite

php artisan migrate --seed

npm install && npm run dev

Start server: php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 (or use Replit run config)

Document how to run tests: php artisan test.

UX copy & small details

Booking confirmation message: “Booking confirmed — Booking ID: {uuid}. Amount: PKR {amount}. We have sent a confirmation SMS (optional).”

Friendly validation messages (e.g., “That slot is already taken — please pick another time or court.”)

Deliverables (what to output)

Ask Replit AI to generate (and commit) the following in the repo:

Full Laravel project scaffolding with the above features implemented.

Migrations, seeders, factories, and sample seed data for courts/sports/bookings.

Blade views: homepage, availability view, booking modal/form, admin dashboard with charts, bookings table.

JS assets: Axios + Chart.js usage + DataTables integration.

Unit/Feature tests for booking logic & routes.

README with exact Replit run instructions (use SQLite) and Postman collection or sample curl commands for API endpoints.

Make sure all code is documented with short comments and follow PSR-12 style.

Example prompt to paste into Replit AI (copy-paste ready)

Build a full Laravel 10 web application implementing an indoor hourly slots booking system with the following requirements:

Two courts ("Court A" and "Court B") and two sports ("Cricket" at 2000 PKR/hr, "Football" at 2500 PKR/hr).

Hourly slots between configurable open/close hours (default 06:00–23:00). Multi-hour bookings allowed.

Prevent double-booking of the same court/time. Validate booking date/time and hours against opening hours.

Booking form collects: name, phone number, sport, court, date, start_time, hours; amount must be auto-calculated and stored.

Admin dashboard with authentication (use Laravel Breeze), bookings table (AJAX + DataTables), and graphs (Chart.js) for revenue, bookings counts, and court occupancy.

Provide API endpoints to fetch daily availability and to create bookings.

Use Blade + Tailwind for frontend; Axios for AJAX.

Include migrations, seeders (courts, sports, sample bookings), tests (unit and feature), and a README with Replit-ready run instructions using SQLite.

Add defensive validation, friendly UX messages, and tests ensuring overlapping bookings are forbidden.

Output a runnable project on Replit with instructions for running migrations/seeding, starting dev server, and running tests.

Follow the data schema and structure described in the prompt, implement booking availability logic on the model or service layer, and generate example seeded bookings to populate the dashboard charts.
